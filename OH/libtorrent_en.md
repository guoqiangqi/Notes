# Ttile: Proposal for OpenHarmony Adaptation of [ libtorrent ]

## Background
OpenHarmony is an open-source project incubated and operated by the OpenAtom Foundation, aiming to build a framework and platform for intelligent terminal device operating systems in the era of all-scenario, all-connection, and all-intelligence.

libtorrent is a critically important C++ library that implements the BitTorrent protocol with most popular extensions. Its efficiency and ease of use make it suitable for both servers and embedded devices, which aligns perfectly with OpenHarmony's vision for diverse device support. Also, libtorrent is currently widely used in the mobile application development of OpenHarmony. We believe that this is also a great opportunity to further expand the user base of libtorrent.

We'll submit the adaptation code through a Pull Request (PR) promptly. We've opened this Issue to engage in in - depth discussions with the community about integrating the adaptation code. Your suggestions are most welcome.

## Adaptation Proposal
We have completed the OpenHarmony adaptation for libtorrent, including:
- Added [specific feature 1] that leverages OpenHarmony's distributed capabilities to enable efficient device collaboration.
- Imporved [specific feature 2] to optimize performance on OpenHarmony's lightweight devices.

These adaptations enhance libtorrent's unique value in the OpenHarmony ecosystem while maintaining all original functionality.

## Testing Results
We have conducted extensive compatibility testing across:
- Different versions of OpenHarmony
- Various OpenHarmony device types

The results show excellent compatibility without significant stability issues. Test reports can be provided as needed.

## Benefits to Upstream Community
- Access to OpenHarmony's vast user base and developer community
- Future-proofing the project by supporting cutting-edge OS trends
- Enhanced capability to handle diverse operating environments

## Labels
enhancement, compatibility, cross-platform
